  <!-- The following code is a chronological annalysis of the unclear gibberish going on in my mind. Please don't take it too seriously -->
    <p>This is the Beginning od beautiful things mostly because I have emerged from the Ashes like a Phoenix. <br>
         Whatever was left undead has <strong>reemerged from the waste lands</strong> </p>
         <p>I am poised to use every trick in the book in ensuring that I see this <em>entire training experience </em> <br>
        to the very end. Please do not ask me to hold anything back because <u>I clearly would not. I am in this to break 
        </u>every barrier that I may have set for myself or even those mental hurdles.  </p>
